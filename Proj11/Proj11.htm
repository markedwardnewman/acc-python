<h2>ITSE 1359 Introduction to Scripting Languages: Python </h2>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Project 11</h2>

<h2>Read The Instructions Carefully</h2>
</center>

<p>A detailed set of instructions is provided in a separate document titled <strong>Instructions for Downloading and Submitting Assignments </strong> that you can
view at the official web site for this course.</p>
<p>I recommend that you study those instructions <strong>very carefully</strong> 
and make yourself a checklist to ensure that you meet all of the 
requirements before submitting your project.</p>
<p>Failure to follow the instructions to the letter usually results in a
failing grade, normally zero. The general instructions in that document apply
to this project. In addition, this document provides specific
instructions for the project. </p>

<p>If you have any questions regarding instructions, please ask them at least
one week prior to the assignment deadline. Don't end up with a bad grade due to the
fact that you didn't understand the instructions. </p>

<p>Every semester there are one or two students who are surprised and saddened
to learn that I really do mean that you must follow the instructions and meet
the specifications exactly or you won't get credit for the assignment. Don't be
one of those students.</p>

<center>
<h2>Typographical Errors</h2>
</center>
<p>If you discover any typographical errors in this document, please let me know
so that I can correct the error and notify all of the students.</p>
<h2 class="auto-style1">Source Code</h2>

<p>You will find a driver source code file named <strong>Proj11.py</strong> 
in the same zip file from which you extracted this project specification.</p>
<h2 class="auto-style1">Python Version Requirements</h2>
<p>Python is somewhat version sensitive, particularly between version 2.x and 
version 3.x. Your project will be graded using Python version 3.4.x or a later version.</p>
<h2 class="auto-style1">Specific Project Requirements</h2>
<p>Specific project requirements follow:</p>

	  <p>PROGRAM SPECIFICATIONS</p>
		<p>Write and submit a Python module named Proj11Runner.py that works in 
		conjunction with the driver source code contained in the file named 
		Proj11.py to produce the output shown below on the command-line screen 
		for the values of the variables named <strong>myKeys</strong> and
		<strong>myValues</strong> showing in the file named Proj11.py.

	  <p>Do not copy the code from the file named Proj11.py into your file named Proj11Runner.py.</p>
	  <p>You may not modify the code in the file named Proj11.py for the purpose 
		of meeting this specification. Your instructor will execute the code in 
		his original version of the file named Proj11.py in the same folder as 
		your file named Proj11Runner.py for the purpose of grading your assignment.</p>
