This is an example of how a python doctest can use a .txt file to find simulated "correct" answers.
Basically, it parses the file, using python's integrated interpreter prompt as a que for the docstring 
The below answers are intentionally incorrect to show that the doctest is indeed working



>>> from Proj04 import getLen
>>> 'Mark Newman'

>>> getLen(['a','b','c'])
