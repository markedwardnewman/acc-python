<h2>Read The Instructions Carefully</h2>
</center>

<p>A detailed set of instructions is provided in a separate document titled <strong>Instructions for Downloading and Submitting Assignments </strong> that you can
view at the official web site for this course.</p>
<p>I recommend that you study those instructions <strong>very carefully</strong> 
and make yourself a checklist to ensure that you meet all of the 
requirements before submitting your project.</p>
<p>Failure to follow the instructions to the letter usually results in a
failing grade, normally zero. The general instructions in that document apply
to this project. In addition, this document provides specific
instructions for the project. </p>

<p>If you have any questions regarding instructions, please ask them at least
one week prior to the assignment deadline. Don't end up with a bad grade due to the
fact that you didn't understand the instructions. </p>

<p>Every semester there are one or two students who are surprised and saddened
to learn that I really do mean that you must follow the instructions and meet
the specifications exactly or you won't get credit for the assignment. Don't be
one of those students.</p>

<center>
<h2>Typographical Errors</h2>
</center>
<p>If you discover any typographical errors in this document, please let me know
so that I can correct the error and notify all of the students.</p>
<h2 class="auto-style1">Source Code</h2>

<p>You will find a driver source code file named <strong>Proj05.py</strong> 
in the same zip file from which you extracted this project specification.</p>
<h2 class="auto-style1">Python Version Requirements</h2>
<p>Python is somewhat version sensitive, particularly between version 2.x and 
version 3.x. Your project will be graded using Python version 3.4.x or a later version.</p>
<h2 class="auto-style1">Specific Project Requirements</h2>
<p>Specific project requirements follow:</p>

      <td><p>Proj05 Copyright 2014 R.G.Baldwin</p>
<p>Among other things, this project involves:
 </p>
<ul>
	<li>String methods (see
	<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods">The 
	Python Standard Library - 4.7.1 String Methods</a>)</li>

	<li>Using skills learned in previous assignments.</li>
</ul>

	  <p>PROGRAM SPECIFICATIONS</p>
		<p>Write and submit a Python module named Proj05Runner.py that works in 
		conjunction with the driver source code contained 
		in the file named Proj05.py to produce the output shown below on the command-line screen 
		for the values of the variables named <strong>str</strong> and <strong>subStr</strong> 
		shown in the file named 
		Proj05.py. 
		</p>

	  <p>More specifically, your module must contain a function named <strong>run</strong>, which 
	  receives an arbitrary string and an arbitrary substring as incoming 
	  parameters. The function must display the string and the substring on 
	  consecutive lines of output. Then the <strong>run</strong> function must locate the substring 
	  in the string. It must extract and return that substring plus three 
	  characters on either end of the substring.</p>
	  <p>Do not copy the code from the file named Proj05.py into your file named Proj05Runner.py.</p>
		<p>Your instructor will substitute a new 
		string and a new substring in 
		his original version of the file named Proj05.py. Then he will execute 
		the modified version of Proj05.py in the same folder as 
		your file named Proj05Runner.py for the purpose of grading your assignment. 
		</p>
	  <p>You may not modify the code in the file named Proj05.py for the purpose 
		of meeting this specification.&nbsp; However, it is recommended that you 
	  modify that code in order to test your program with different strings and 
		different substrings to confirm proper operation before submission.</p>
